INSTRUCTIONS
============

Running the 'make' command should build all components of the system. Following 
executables should be placed in the 'bin' directory:

bin/viewer            -- primary data visualization tool

bin/ppms2mpeg4        -- tool for converting video clips produced by the viewer
                         into MPEG-4 video files.  Requires ffmpeg


To view a log file (distributed separately), use the lcm-logplayer-gui command
(distributed with lcm)

    $ lcm-logplayer-gui <logfile>

Then, in a separate terminal, run the viewer

    $ bin/viewer

NOTES
=====

bin/viewer is capable of recording video clips.  Select the desired frame rate
and click the "Record" button.  Files will be saved to the current directory,
with the extension ".ppms.gz"  Recorded clips consist of a list of PPM files
one after another, all in the same file, and gzipped (hence the name ppms.gz)

To convert a viewer-recorded clip to a standard video format, use ffmpeg, 
the bin/ppms2mpeg4 script, or a variant thereof.
